One of the common issues that users may encounter when using Gerber Accumark 9.0 is the error creating new piece 115b. This error affects the system files of Windows and can be fixed by adjusting the system date to match the date of the pattern creation[^1^]. For example, if the pattern P704288 was created on March 30, 2019, users need to change the system date to March 30, 2019 before opening the pattern file. After opening and saving the file, users can change the system date back to the current date. This method can solve the error for the current file, but users may need to repeat it for other files that have the same issue.
