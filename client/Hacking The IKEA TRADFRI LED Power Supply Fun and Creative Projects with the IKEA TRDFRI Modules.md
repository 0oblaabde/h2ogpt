## How To Hack The IKEA TRADFRI LED Power Supply
 
Once you have gathered all the items you need, you can follow these steps to hack the IKEA TRADFRI LED power supply:

1. Open the IKEA TRADFRI LED power supply by removing the four screws on the back. Be careful not to damage the circuit board or the wires inside.
2. Locate the two wires that connect the power supply to the wireless dimmer. They are usually red and black, and they are soldered to two pads on the circuit board labeled "DIM+". Cut these wires close to the pads and strip the ends.
3. Use your multimeter to measure the voltage between the two pads. It should be around 3V when the wireless dimmer is off, and around 0V when it is on. This is how the power supply detects whether the wireless dimmer is on or off.
4. Solder two wires to the two pads where you cut the wires from the wireless dimmer. These wires will connect to your switch of choice.
5. Close the IKEA TRADFRI LED power supply and reattach the four screws.
6. Connect your switch of choice to the two wires you soldered to the power supply. Make sure that the polarity is correct. For example, if you are using a wall switch, connect one wire to the live terminal and one wire to the switched live terminal. If you are using a dimmer or a remote control, follow the instructions that came with it.
7. Connect your IKEA TRADFRI smart lights to the output of the power supply. You can use up to 10 lights per power supply.
8. Plug in your power supply and test your switch. You should be able to turn on and off your smart lights with your switch of choice.

## Tips And Tricks
 
Here are some tips and tricks to make your hacking experience easier and better:

- If you want to hide your power supply and your switch behind a wall or a cabinet, you can drill some holes and use some screws to mount them securely.
- If you want to use multiple switches for your smart lights, you can connect them in parallel to the same two wires from the power supply. For example, you can use a wall switch and a remote control for the same set of lights.
- If you want to use different types of switches for different sets of lights, you can use multiple power supplies and connect them in parallel to the same mains outlet. For example, you can use 8cf37b1e13
