After updating your router firmware, you may want to change some settings to optimize your router performance and security. Here are some tips on how to configure your router:

- Change your router password. The default password of admin is easy to guess and may expose your router to unauthorized access. To change your password, go to System Tools > Password and enter a new password. Make sure you use a strong and unique password that you can remember.
- Change your wireless network name and password. The default wireless network name (SSID) and password (WPA key) are usually printed on a label at the bottom of your router. However, you may want to change them to something more personal and secure. To change them, go to Wireless > Basic Settings and enter a new SSID and WPA key. You can also choose the wireless mode, channel and bandwidth according to your preference.
- Enable firewall and security features. Your router has a built-in firewall that can protect your network from malicious attacks. You can also enable some security features such as MAC filtering, IP filtering, URL filtering and port forwarding to control the access and traffic on your network. To enable them, go to Security > Firewall or Security > Advanced Settings and configure the options as needed.
- Update your router firmware regularly. Updating your router firmware can fix bugs, improve performance and add new features to your router. You can check for firmware updates manually by going to System Tools > Firmware Upgrade and clicking Check for Updates. You can also enable automatic updates by going to System Tools > Auto Update and choosing the update frequency and time.

By following these steps, you can make the most out of your ZTE ZXV10 W300 router.
