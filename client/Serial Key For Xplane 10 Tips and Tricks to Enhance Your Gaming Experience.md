Xplane 10 is a realistic flight simulator that lets you explore the world in various aircraft models. If you have purchased Xplane 10 as a digital download from x-plane.org, you will need a serial key to activate it. Here are some ways to find your serial key for Xplane 10:
 
- Check your email for the order confirmation from x-plane.org. It should contain your serial key along with the download details. [^2^]
- Log in to your x-plane.org account and go to your order history. You should be able to see your serial key for Xplane 10 under the product name. [^3^]
- If you have bought Xplane 10 from Steam, you don't need a serial key. You can just launch the game from your Steam library. [^1^]

If none of these methods work, you can contact the x-plane.org support team or the Flight Factor website and provide them with your order details. They should be able to help you recover your serial key.
