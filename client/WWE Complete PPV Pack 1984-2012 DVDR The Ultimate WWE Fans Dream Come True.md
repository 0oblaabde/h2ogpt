One of the advantages of having the WWE Complete PPV Pack 1984-2012 DVDR is that you can watch some of the best and worst rated events in WWE history. You can compare your own opinions with those of critics and fans, and see how WWE has changed over the years. According to Wrestlenomics[^1^], some of the highest rated WWE pay-per-views from 1984 to 2012 are:
 
- WrestleMania X-Seven (2001): This is widely considered to be the best WrestleMania ever, and one of the greatest wrestling shows of all time. It featured a stacked card, with matches such as TLC II, Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit, and The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin.
- Money in the Bank (2011): This was a historic night for WWE, as CM Punk defeated John Cena for the WWE Championship in his hometown of Chicago, and left the company with the title. The match had an incredible atmosphere and storytelling, and is regarded as one of the best matches in WWE history.
- SummerSlam (2002): This was a star-making show for Brock Lesnar, who defeated The Rock for the WWE Championship in the main event. It also featured Shawn Michaels' return to the ring after four years, as he faced Triple H in an unsanctioned street fight.

On the other hand, some of the lowest rated WWE pay-per-views from 1984 to 2012 are:

- December to Dismember (2006): This was a disaster of a show, headlined by an Extreme Elimination Chamber match for the ECW Championship. The match was poorly booked and executed, and resulted in fans chanting for refunds. The show also had a weak undercard, with matches such as Balls Mahoney vs. Matt Striker.
- Battleground (2013): This was a disappointing show, marred by a non-finish in the main event between Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton for the vacant WWE Championship. The match ended with Big Show interfering and knocking out both men, leaving no winner. The show also had filler matches such as Curtis Axel vs. R-Truth and Kofi Kingston vs. Bray Wyatt.
- King of the Ring (1995): This was a boring and predictable show, with Mabel winning the King of the Ring tournament by defeating Savio Vega in the final. The show also had a lackluster main event between Diesel and Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Sid and Tatanka.

The WWE Complete PPV Pack 1984-2012 DVDR gives you access to all these events and more, allowing you to experience the highs and lows of WWE's pay-per-view history.
