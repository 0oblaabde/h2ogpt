# How to Perform a Fujezone Smart Tab Mt12 Hard Reset
 
If you are experiencing problems with your Fujezone Smart Tab Mt12, such as freezing, crashing, or slow performance, you may need to perform a hard reset. A hard reset will erase all your data and settings and restore your device to its factory default state. This can help you fix any software issues and improve your tablet's performance. However, before you proceed with a hard reset, make sure you backup your important data and files to an external storage device or cloud service. You will also need to charge your battery to at least 50% to avoid any interruptions during the process.
