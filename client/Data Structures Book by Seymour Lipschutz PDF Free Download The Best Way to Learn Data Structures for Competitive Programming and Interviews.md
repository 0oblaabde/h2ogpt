Data structures are an essential part of computer science and programming. They are used to store and organize data in a way that makes it easy to access and manipulate. Data structures can also affect the performance and efficiency of algorithms that operate on them. Therefore, it is important to learn how to choose and implement the right data structure for a given problem.
