I tried exporting my project using the modified 03: 000000 c97 option, which converts the Allplan paper layout to an Autocad layout and includes the nwd name in the layer names. This option worked well for creating unique names for every layer of every nwd file in the exported layout. However, Allplan failed to freeze the layers in the viewport, which means I could not control their visibility in Autocad.
  
This problem was very frustrating because I wanted to export my layout as a PDF file and share it with my colleagues. However, the PDF file showed all the layers, even the ones that I did not want to display. I tried to freeze the layers manually in Autocad, but it was too time-consuming and tedious.

I searched online for a solution and found out that this was a known issue with Allplan. Apparently, the modified 03: 000000 c97 option does not respect the layer settings in Allplan and exports all the layers as visible. Some users suggested using a different option, such as 03: 000000 c96 or 03: 000000 c95, which do not include the nwd name in the layer names but do freeze the layers in the viewport.
  
I decided to try one of these options and see if it would work better. I chose 03: 000000 c96 and exported my layout again. This time, the layers were frozen in the viewport and I could control their visibility in Autocad. However, the layer names were not unique anymore and I had to rename them manually to avoid confusion. This was also a tedious task, but at least I could export my layout as a PDF file with the correct layer visibility.

I wondered if there was a way to combine the advantages of both options and export my layout with unique layer names and frozen layers in the viewport. I searched online again and found a forum post that suggested a workaround. The post said that I could use the modified 03: 000000 c97 option and then run a script in Autocad that would freeze the layers based on their names. The script would look for the nwd name in the layer name and freeze all the layers that did not match the current nwd file.
  
I decided to give this a try and downloaded the script from the forum. I ran it in Autocad and it worked like a charm. It froze all the layers that were not relevant to the current nwd file and left only the ones that I wanted to see. I was very happy with this solution and thanked the forum user who shared it. I exported my layout as a PDF file and sent it to my colleagues. They were impressed by the quality and clarity of my layout and praised me for my work.
  
I learned a lot from this experience and realized that sometimes there is no perfect option for exporting a layout from Allplan to Autocad. However, with some creativity and research, I could find a workaround that would suit my needs and expectations. I also learned that sharing problems and solutions online can be very helpful and rewarding. I hope that this text will help other users who face similar issues with Allplan and Autocad.
