# Infaq Fi Sabilillah: The Virtue of Spending for the Sake of Allah
 
Infaq fi sabilillah is an Arabic term that means spending or giving in the cause of Allah, or for the sake of Allah. It is one of the forms of charity (sadaqah) that Muslims are encouraged to perform, especially in times of need and hardship. Infaq fi sabilillah can be done in various ways, such as donating money, food, clothes, books, or any other useful items to the poor, the needy, the orphans, the widows, the travelers, the students, the mosques, the schools, or any other noble cause that serves Islam and humanity.
 
The Quran and the Sunnah are full of verses and hadiths that highlight the importance and reward of infaq fi sabilillah. Allah says in the Quran: "The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing." (Quran 2:261)

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever spends a pair in the way of Allah will be called from the gates of Paradise: 'O servant of Allah, this is good.' Whoever is among the people of prayer will be called from the gate of prayer. Whoever is among the people of jihad will be called from the gate of jihad. Whoever is among the people of charity will be called from the gate of charity. Whoever is among the people of fasting will be called from the gate of fasting." (Bukhari and Muslim)
 
Infaq fi sabilillah is not only beneficial for the recipients, but also for the givers. It purifies their wealth, their hearts, and their souls. It increases their faith, their gratitude, and their generosity. It protects them from greed, selfishness, and miserliness. It brings them closer to Allah and His mercy. It earns them His forgiveness, His pleasure, and His paradise.

One of the ways to learn more about infaq fi sabilillah is to read books and articles that explain its meaning, its types, its conditions, its etiquette, and its examples.

The book can be downloaded from [this link](http://pantogo.org/2022/08/04/infaq-fi-sabilillah-in-urdu-pdf-54/). The book covers various aspects of infaq fi sabilillah, such as its definition, its categories, its virtues, its benefits, its obstacles, its manners, its recipients, its sources, its times, its amounts, and its evidences.
 
Infaq fi sabilillah is a noble deed that every Muslim should strive to perform regularly and sincerely. It is a way of expressing our love for Allah and His messenger (peace be upon him), our solidarity with our fellow Muslims and human beings, and our hope for His reward and paradise. May Allah accept our infaq fi sabilillah and make us among those who are called from the gates of paradise.
  
One of the best ways to practice infaq fi sabilillah is to join and support organizations that are working for the cause of Allah and His religion. These organizations can be local, national, or international, depending on the scope and nature of their activities. They can be involved in various fields, such as education, da'wah, relief, development, social welfare, human rights, or any other field that serves the interests of Islam and Muslims.
 
One such organization is ICNA Sisters Wing, which is a division of Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA), one of the largest and most active Islamic organizations in North America. ICNA Sisters Wing aims to provide Islamic education and training to women of all backgrounds, to promote Islamic values and principles in society, to foster sisterhood and unity among Muslim women, and to participate in humanitarian and social justice causes.
 
ICNA Sisters Wing has a system of Bait-ul-Maal (House of Wealth), which is a fund that collects and distributes money for various projects and programs that fall under the category of infaq fi sabilillah. The Bait-ul-Maal receives money from various sources, such as CDs, books, companion noor, sadaqah, zakah, donations, and ayanat. The money is then spent on various expenses, such as rent, utilities, salaries, scholarships, publications, events, da'wah materials, relief aid, and other miscellaneous items.
 
The Bait-ul-Maal system is based on transparency, accountability, and efficiency. The money is collected and recorded at the sub-unit level (local chapters), then transferred to the unit level (regional chapters), then to the national level (headquarters). The money is spent according to the budget approved by the shura (consultative council) of each level. The financial reports are audited and presented to the members and the public on a regular basis.
 
The Bait-ul-Maal system is a great example of how Muslims can practice infaq fi sabilillah in an organized and effective way. By contributing to the Bait-ul-Maal, Muslims can support the noble work of ICNA Sisters Wing and other similar organizations that are striving for the sake of Allah. By spending in the way of Allah, Muslims can earn His blessings in this world and the hereafter.
