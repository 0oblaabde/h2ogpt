The Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) is a public examination for students who have completed their five years of secondary education. The HKCEE Chemistry exam tests the students' knowledge and skills in various aspects of chemistry, such as atomic structure, chemical reactions, organic chemistry, and environmental chemistry. The exam consists of two papers: Paper I and Paper II. Paper I is a multiple-choice paper with 50 questions, while Paper II is a written paper with six compulsory questions and two optional questions. The total mark for the exam is 200.

One of the best ways to prepare for the HKCEE Chemistry exam is to study the past papers and marking schemes. The marking scheme is a document that shows how the examiners mark the answers and allocate marks for each question. It also provides some sample answers and common errors to avoid. Studying the marking scheme can help students understand the requirements and expectations of the examiners, as well as improve their answering techniques and time management.
 
In this article, we will provide some tips on how to use the marking scheme of the 2006 HKCEE Chemistry Paper I to revise for the exam. The 2006 HKCEE Chemistry Paper I marking scheme can be found online at [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/document/6602853/2006-Chemistry-Paper-I-Marking-Scheme) [^2^] or [Microsoft Sway](https://sway.office.com/MYDGzp45HSB7ppcA) [^3^]. You can also access some of the HKCEE and HKALE question papers of a few subjects at [MMIS - Hong Kong Public Libraries](https://mmis.hkpl.gov.hk/hkcee-and-hkale-papers-collection) [^1^].
 
## Tips on Using the Marking Scheme of the 2006 HKCEE Chemistry Paper I
 
- Read the marking scheme carefully and note down the key points, keywords, and symbols that are required for each question. For example, in question 1(a), you need to write down the equation for the reaction between silver nitrate and sodium chloride, as well as indicate the state symbols and charges of the ions. In question 1(b), you need to explain why silver chloride is insoluble in water, using the concept of solubility product.
- Compare your answers with the marking scheme and check if you have included all the relevant information and details. If you have missed or written something wrong, correct it and learn from your mistakes. For example, in question 2(a), you need to state that iron(III) oxide is reduced to iron by carbon monoxide, not carbon dioxide. In question 2(b), you need to mention that copper(II) oxide is black and copper metal is brown.
- Pay attention to the marks allocated for each question and sub-question. The marks reflect the difficulty and complexity of the question, as well as the amount of information and explanation required. For example, question 3(a) is worth 4 marks, which means you need to provide four pieces of information or calculations to get full marks. In this case, you need to calculate the number of moles of nitric acid in 2.0 g of nitric acid, write down the balanced equation for the reaction between nitric acid and sodium hydroxide, calculate the number of moles of sodium hydroxide required for complete neutralization, and calculate the mass of sodium hydroxide required.
- Practice answering the questions under exam conditions. Set a timer and try to finish all 50 questions within one hour. This will help you improve your speed and accuracy, as well as familiarize yourself with the format and style of the questions. After finishing, mark your answers using the marking scheme and see how well you did. Identify your strengths and weaknesses, and focus on improving your weak areas.

By following these tips, you can make good use of the marking scheme of the 2006 HKCEE Chemistry Paper I to prepare for your exam. Remember that practice makes perfect, so keep revising and practicing until you are confident and ready for your exam. Good
