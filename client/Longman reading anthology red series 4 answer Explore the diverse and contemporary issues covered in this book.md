- Do not look at the answer key before attempting the exercises. Try to answer the questions on your own first, using your own knowledge and skills. This will help you develop your reading and thinking abilities.
- After completing the exercises, compare your answers with the answer key. If your answers are correct, congratulate yourself and move on to the next text. If your answers are incorrect or incomplete, try to understand why you made a mistake and how you can avoid it in the future.
- Use the answer key as a learning tool, not as a cheating tool. Do not copy the answers from the answer key without understanding them. This will not help you improve your reading skills or prepare for exams. Instead, use the answer key to learn new vocabulary, grammar rules, and writing techniques.
- Review the answer key regularly. After finishing a unit or a chapter, go back to the answer key and review the exercises you did. This will help you consolidate what you have learned and remember it better.
