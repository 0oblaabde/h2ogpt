# How to Use Automation Studio Hydraulic Library for Fluid Power Systems Design and Simulation
 
Automation Studio is a circuit design, simulation and project documentation software for fluid power systems and electrical projects conceived by Famic Technologies Inc. [^2^]. It is used for CAD, maintenance, and training purposes by engineers, trainers, and service and maintenance personnel. Automation Studio can be applied in the design, training and troubleshooting of hydraulics, pneumatics, HMI, and electrical control systems [^2^].
 
One of the features of Automation Studio is the hydraulic library, which contains a wide array of components to create basic to advanced hydraulic systems or reproduce your hydraulic trainer. Users can change any component's parameters to reflect their own applications or assignments [^1^]. The hydraulic library follows the ISO standards and uses modeling techniques such as the Bernoulli's law and the gradient method [^2^].

In this article, we will show you how to use Automation Studio hydraulic library for fluid power systems design and simulation. We will cover the following steps:
 
1. Creating a new project and selecting the hydraulic technology.
2. Adding components from the hydraulic library to the schematic.
3. Connecting the components and setting their properties.
4. Running the simulation and analyzing the results.
5. Generating reports and documentation.

## Step 1: Creating a new project and selecting the hydraulic technology
 
To create a new project in Automation Studio, click on File > New > Project. Give your project a name and a description. Then, select the Hydraulic technology from the list of available technologies. You can also select other technologies if you want to combine them with hydraulics in your project. Click on OK to create your project.
 
You will see a blank schematic page where you can start drawing your hydraulic circuit. You can also add more pages if you need to create multiple circuits or subcircuits. To add a new page, right-click on the Pages tab at the bottom of the screen and select Add Page.
 
## Step 2: Adding components from the hydraulic library to the schematic
 
To add components from the hydraulic library to your schematic, click on the Library icon on the toolbar or press F9. You will see a list of categories and subcategories of hydraulic components. You can browse through them or use the search function to find the component you need. To add a component to your schematic, drag and drop it from the library window to your schematic page.
 
You can also use the Manufacturer's Catalogue feature to access components from specific manufacturers. To access this feature, click on Tools > Manufacturer's Catalogue. You will see a list of manufacturers and their products. You can browse through them or use the search function to find the component you need. To add a component from the Manufacturer's Catalogue to your schematic, drag and drop it from the catalogue window to your schematic page.

## Step 3: Connecting the components and setting their properties
 
To connect the components in your schematic, use the Connection tool on the toolbar or press F3. Click on one component's port and then click on another component's port to create a connection line between them. You can also use junctions, tees, elbows, reducers, etc. to create more complex connections.
 
To set the properties of a component or a connection line, double-click on it or right-click on it and select Properties. You will see a dialog box where you can change various parameters such as name, description, symbol, size, color, position, orientation, etc. You can also enter values for physical properties such as pressure, flow rate, temperature, viscosity, etc.
 
## Step 4: Running the simulation and analyzing the results
 
To run the simulation of your hydraulic circuit, click on Simulation > Run Simulation or press F5. You will see a dialog box where you can select the simulation mode (steady state or transient), simulation time (start time, end time, time step), simulation options (solver type, tolerance, etc.), and output options (variables to plot or export). Click on OK to start the simulation.
 
You will see your schematic page animated with colors indicating pressure levels and flow directions. You can also see numerical values for various
