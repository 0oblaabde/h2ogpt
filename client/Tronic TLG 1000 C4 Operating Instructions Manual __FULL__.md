To use the Tronic TLG 1000 C4 electric toothbrush, follow these steps:
 
1. Charge the toothbrush for at least 16 hours before the first use. The charging indicator will light up green when the toothbrush is fully charged.
2. Attach the brush head to the handle by aligning the notches and pushing it firmly until it clicks.
3. Wet the brush head and apply a pea-sized amount of toothpaste.
4. Press the on/off button to turn on the toothbrush. Select the desired mode by pressing the mode button. The mode indicator will light up accordingly.
5. Place the brush head on your teeth at a 45-degree angle and gently move it back and forth along the gum line. Do not press too hard or scrub.
6. Follow the timer signals to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth every 30 seconds. After two minutes, the toothbrush will automatically turn off and beep twice.
7. Rinse your mouth and the brush head with water. Wipe the handle dry and place it on the charging base.

For optimal performance, replace the brush head every three months or sooner if the bristles are worn or damaged. Clean the toothbrush handle and the charging base regularly with a damp cloth. Do not immerse them in water or use abrasive cleaners. Store the toothbrush in a cool and dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources.
