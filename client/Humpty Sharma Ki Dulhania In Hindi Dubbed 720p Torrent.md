Humpty reaches Ambala and meets Kavya's family, who are initially hostile towards him. He tries to impress them with his charm and wit, but fails to win over Kavya's father, Kamaljeet Singh, a strict and conservative man who believes in arranged marriages. Kamaljeet reveals that he has already chosen a groom for Kavya, Angad Bedi, a handsome and successful NRI doctor from America. Humpty is heartbroken, but he does not give up hope. He challenges Kamaljeet that he will prove himself to be a better suitor for Kavya than Angad.
 
Humpty enlists the help of his friends and Kavya's sister, Swati, who had eloped with her boyfriend against her father's wishes and is now divorced. He tries to find out Angad's flaws and expose them to Kamaljeet, but he fails every time. He also tries to make Kavya realize her love for him, but she is torn between her loyalty to her father and her feelings for Humpty. She tells Humpty that she cannot go against her father's wishes, as he had suffered a lot because of Swati's marriage. She also tells him that Angad is a nice guy who loves her and respects her family.
 
Humpty realizes that he has no chance of winning Kavya's hand, and decides to leave Ambala. However, on his way back to Delhi, he meets Angad at a dhaba. Angad tells him that he knows about Humpty and Kavya's relationship, and that he is not happy with the marriage either. He reveals that he is gay, and that he had agreed to marry Kavya only to please his parents, who are unaware of his sexuality. He also tells him that he loves Kavya as a friend, and that he wants her to be happy with Humpty.
 
Humpty is shocked by this revelation, and decides to go back to Ambala with Angad. He confronts Kamaljeet with the truth about Angad, and asks him to let Kavya marry him instead. Kamaljeet is furious, and accuses Humpty of lying and trying to ruin his daughter's life. He orders him to leave the house immediately. Kavya is confused and hurt by Humpty's actions, and asks him why he did this. Humpty tells her that he loves her more than anything in the world, and that he cannot live without her. He also tells her that Angad is gay, and that he does not love her the way he does.
 
Kavya is stunned by this news, and does not know what to believe. She asks Angad if this is true, and he confirms it. He apologizes to her for hiding his identity from her, and tells her that he only wants her happiness. He also tells her that Humpty is the right guy for her, and that she should go with him. Kavya is overwhelmed by this turn of events, and breaks down in tears.
