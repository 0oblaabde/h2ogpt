- **Subscription License:** This is a paid license that allows you to use Quartus II 13 software and all previous versions, as well as all versions released within a year of the purchase date. You can also use the ModelSim-Intel FPGA Edition software and the IP Library with this license. A subscription license can be either node-locked or networked. A node-locked license is tied to a specific computer and can only be used on that computer. A networked license is tied to a server and can be shared by multiple users over a network.
- **Web Edition License:** This is a free license that allows you to use Quartus II 13 Web Edition software and all previous versions. You can also use the ModelSim-Intel FPGA Starter Edition software and a limited set of IP cores with this license. A web edition license can only be node-locked.
- **Additional Software License:** This is a paid license that allows you to use additional software that is not included in the subscription or web edition licenses, such as purchased MegaCore functions, the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL, and the Intel SoC FPGA Embedded Design Suite (EDS). An additional software license can be either node-locked or networked.
